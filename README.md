**work flow--

-customer data-data pre processing (select key features)
-data analysis (features-we require and what data contains)
-choose correct number of clusters(optimum number of cluster -- by using within cluster sumup squares -> wcss value--- tells correct no. of clusters )
-k means clustering algorithm
-visualing the clusters by plots
